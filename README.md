# animal_image_classifier
Image Classifications using CNN on different type of animals.
Purpose:
Classify species of animals based on pictures. Can automatically help identify animals in the wild taken by wildlife conservatories. Can lead to discoveries of potential new habitat as well as new unseen species of animals within the same class.

Method:
Train images of animals from six different species with thousands of labeled pictures in a VGG16 transfer learning model using Convulational Neural Network.

Dataset:
Data came from Animals-10 dataset in kaggle. Only chose six of the available species due to computer processing limitations, as well as fixed time window to run experiment.
